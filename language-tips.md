# Language and Framework Tips for Small Model Agents

Specific strategies for each language/framework, tuned for models with limited reasoning.

---

## TypeScript / JavaScript

**Leverage the type-checker as a co-pilot.** After every edit, run `npx tsc --noEmit` (or the project's type-check command). The type-checker catches: wrong argument types, missing properties, incorrect return types, and bad imports. This is the single most valuable verification for TS projects with small models.

**Import verification pattern:**
```bash
# Before writing an import, check what's actually exported
grep "export" src/target-module.ts | head -20
# Check how others import from this module
grep -r "from.*target-module" src/ | head -10
```

**Async traps to watch for:**
- Never write `async` code without a corresponding `await` — grep for bare promises: `grep -n "async\|await\|\.then\|Promise" <file>`
- Error handling: if the existing code uses try/catch, match that; if it uses `.catch()`, match that. Don't mix styles.

**React-specific:**
- Edit ONE component per step. Never change a component and its parent in the same edit.
- After editing a component, check the console for errors (or run tests) before touching anything else.
- For state changes: read the current useState/useReducer setup first. Don't add new state without verifying the component's existing state shape.
- Props drilling: always check the parent to confirm the prop name and type match.

## Python

**Test early and often.** Python has no compiler to catch errors, so running the code IS the verification. After every edit:
```bash
# Run the specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_target.py::test_specific -x -v
# Or at minimum, check syntax
python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('target.py').read())"
```

**Virtual environment awareness:**
- Before installing anything, check what's already installed: `pip list | grep <package>`
- Before importing, verify the package name matches the import name (they often differ): `python -c "import <module_name>"`

**Common Python model hallucinations:**
- Inventing `pandas` methods that don't exist (e.g., `df.transform_columns()`) — always check with `dir(df)` or grep for usage
- Wrong `datetime` formatting codes — check existing usage in the project
- Mixing up `os.path` and `pathlib` — match the project's style

**Django/Flask/FastAPI:**
- Read the existing route pattern before adding a new one
- Check existing model fields before adding migrations
- Verify serializer/schema definitions match the model

---

## Rust

**The compiler is your best friend.** After every edit, run `cargo check`. Rust's compiler messages are extremely informative — when an edit fails `cargo check`, the error message usually contains the exact fix needed.

**Borrow checker strategy:**
- Don't try to reason about lifetimes abstractly. Write the simplest version (using `.clone()` if needed), verify it compiles, then optimize.
- If a borrow-checker error appears, paste the exact error message into your working memory and address it directly.

**Pattern matching exhaustiveness:**
- After adding a new enum variant, `cargo check` will show every match that needs updating. Fix them one at a time.

---

## Go

**`go vet` and `go build` after every edit.** Go's compilation is fast and catches most issues.

**Common model mistakes in Go:**
- Forgetting to handle errors (Go's `err` return values). After editing, grep for unhandled errors: `grep -n "_ =" <file>`
- Wrong struct field tags (json, db, etc.) — check existing structs for the tag format
- Interface satisfaction — when implementing an interface, read the interface definition first and implement methods one at a time

---

## Shell Scripts / Bash

**Extra caution needed.** Shell scripts are the most dangerous for small models because there's no type-checker and errors are subtle (wrong quoting, word splitting, globbing).

**Verification approach:**
- Use `shellcheck <script.sh>` after every edit if available
- Test with `bash -n <script.sh>` (syntax check) before running
- For complex scripts, test each section independently

**Small model shell pitfalls:**
- Quoting: always use `"$variable"` not `$variable` — models frequently forget quotes
- `[[ ]]` vs `[ ]` — check which the script already uses and match it
- Exit codes: always check `$?` or use `set -e` — models frequently chain commands without error checking

---

## SQL

**Never run a model-generated query without reviewing it first.** Especially:
- Any DELETE, UPDATE, DROP, or ALTER statement
- Any query without a WHERE clause
- Any query joining more than 2 tables

**Verification approach:**
- For SELECT queries: run with `LIMIT 5` first to sanity-check the output shape
- For mutations: wrap in a transaction and verify before committing
- For schema changes: dump the current schema first, make the change, diff the result

---

## CSS / Styling

Small models are surprisingly bad at CSS. Common issues:
- Generating properties that don't exist or are deprecated
- Wrong selector specificity reasoning
- Generating pixel values that look plausible but are wrong

**Strategy:** Find the closest existing example in the codebase and modify it, rather than generating CSS from scratch. Read the existing design tokens / CSS variables first.

---

## Java

**The compiler and IDE are your safety net.** After every edit, run `mvn compile` or `gradle build`. Java's strict typing catches most model mistakes at compile time.

**Common model mistakes in Java:**
- Wrong package/import paths — check existing imports in the file before adding new ones: `grep "^import" src/main/java/com/example/TargetFile.java`
- Mixing up similar classes (`List` vs `ArrayList`, `Map` vs `HashMap`) — match what the file already uses
- Wrong exception handling — check if the method signature declares `throws` before adding try/catch
- Annotation mistakes (`@Override`, `@Autowired`, `@Inject`) — grep for existing usage patterns in the project

**Spring/Jakarta-specific:**
- Read existing controller/service patterns before adding new ones — Spring has many ways to do the same thing
- Check existing `application.properties` / `application.yml` before adding config
- For dependency injection, match the project's style (`@Autowired` field injection vs constructor injection)

---

## Kotlin

**Lean on the compiler.** Run `gradle build` or `kotlinc` after every edit. Kotlin's null-safety and type inference catch many errors.

**Common model mistakes in Kotlin:**
- Confusing `val` vs `var`, `?` vs `!!` — read existing code to match the project's null-handling style
- Wrong coroutine scope usage — grep for `launch`, `async`, `runBlocking` to see the existing pattern
- Mixing Java and Kotlin idioms — check if the file uses Kotlin idioms (`let`, `apply`, `also`) or Java-style code, and match it

**Android-specific:**
- Edit one Activity/Fragment at a time. Never change a Fragment and its hosting Activity in the same step.
- Check existing lifecycle handling before adding new callbacks
- Verify resource IDs exist: `grep -r "R.id.your_id" src/`

---

## Swift

**Use the compiler aggressively.** Run `swift build` or `xcodebuild` after every edit. Swift's type system is strict and informative.

**Common model mistakes in Swift:**
- Optional handling — models frequently forget `?`, `!`, `guard let`, `if let`. Read the existing pattern in the file before editing
- Wrong `struct` vs `class` choice — check what the project uses for similar types
- Protocol conformance — read the protocol definition first, implement methods one at a time
- Mixing up `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`, `@StateObject` in SwiftUI — grep for existing usage patterns

**iOS-specific:**
- Edit one View/ViewController at a time
- Check existing storyboard/XIB connections before modifying outlets
- For SwiftUI, verify the preview compiles after each edit

---

## C# / .NET

**`dotnet build` after every edit.** C#'s compiler is strict and provides clear error messages.

**Common model mistakes in C#:**
- Wrong namespace/using statements — check existing usings at the top of the file
- Mixing up `async Task` vs `async void` — `async void` is almost always wrong except for event handlers
- LINQ mistakes — models generate plausible-but-wrong LINQ chains. Test with a small dataset first
- Dependency injection registration — check `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` for existing DI patterns

**ASP.NET-specific:**
- Read existing controller patterns before adding new endpoints
- Check `appsettings.json` for config structure before adding new config
- Match existing middleware ordering — middleware order matters in ASP.NET

---

## Elixir

**Run `mix compile` after every edit.** Elixir's compiler warnings catch most issues.

**Common model mistakes in Elixir:**
- Wrong pattern matching — models often generate patterns that don't match the actual data shape. Always read the calling code to see what's being passed
- Pipe operator mistakes — models chain `|>` incorrectly, especially with functions that take multiple args
- Module naming — verify the module exists: `grep -r "defmodule.*ModuleName" lib/`

**Phoenix-specific:**
- Read existing router/controller/context patterns before adding new ones
- Check existing migration style before writing new migrations
- Verify schema fields match the database: read the latest migration

---

## Zig

**`zig build` after every edit.** Zig's compiler errors are detailed and usually point to the exact fix.

**Common model mistakes in Zig:**
- Memory management — models forget `defer` for cleanup or use wrong allocators. Grep for the allocator pattern used in the file
- Error handling — Zig uses `try`, `catch`, error unions. Read existing functions to match the pattern
- Comptime vs runtime confusion — don't generate comptime code from memory, read existing examples

---

## Python (addendum)

**Use static analysis when available.** If the project has `mypy` or `pyright` configured, run them after every edit — they catch type errors that runtime testing misses:
```bash
mypy target.py --no-error-summary
# or
pyright target.py
```
Check for config: `ls mypy.ini pyproject.toml setup.cfg` and grep for `[mypy]` or `[tool.pyright]`.

## General Principles Across All Languages

1. **Copy existing patterns.** The safest code a small model can write is a close adaptation of existing code in the project. `grep` for similar functionality before writing anything new.

2. **Prefer standard library over external packages.** Small models hallucinate third-party APIs much more than standard library APIs.

3. **One concept per edit.** Don't add a new function AND call it in the same edit. Add the function → verify → add the call → verify.

4. **When in doubt, be explicit.** Small models do better with `if (condition === true)` than `if (condition)`, with explicit type annotations than inferred types, with named variables than inline expressions. Clarity over cleverness.
